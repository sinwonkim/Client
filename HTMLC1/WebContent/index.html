    <h1 id="h1">Samuel Beckett</h1>
    <p>To what writer, besides Ayn Rand, do the business-minded techies and tech-minded businessmen of 21st-century Silicon Valley look for their inspiration? The name of Samuel Beckett may not, at first, strike you as an obvious answer — unless, of course, you know the origin of the phrase "Fail better." It appears five times in Beckett's 1983 story "Worstward Ho," the first of which goes like this: "Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better." The sentiment seems to resonate naturally with the mentality demanded by the world of tech startups, where nearly every venture ends in failure, but failure which may well contain the seeds of future success.</p>
    <p>Uganda, one of North Korea's traditional close allies on the African continent, has declared that it will suspend its security and military cooperation with Pyongyang to work parallel with the U.N. sanctions against the communist state.</p>
    <p>The Ugandan move comes in the wake of a summit meeting between South Korean President Park Geun-Hye and her Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni in Kampala on Sunday.</p>
    <p>Instead, the African nation signed a deal with South Korea on defense cooperation in a gesture of its shift in diplomacy regarding the divided Korean Peninsula.</p>
    <p>Park and Museveni also agreed on South Korea's active cooperation and participation in Uganda's economic development projects involving such sectors as agriculture, infrastructure, energy, and information technology.</p>
    <p>President Moon Jae-in on Wednesday once again stressed the importance of peace on the peninsula, saying peace will lay the foundations for economic expansion for South Korea. </p>
    <p>“The peace that we have now is a tentative peace. In the new year, (I) will do my best to make the flow of peace an irreversible wave,” Moon said in his New Year’s speech at the Korea Federation of SMEs in Seoul. </p>
    <p>Saying that once peace and complete denuclearization are achieved, an era in which “peace tows prosperity can be opened,” Moon went on to highlight his plans for establishing a “community of peace and prosperity” that spans across Asia. </p>
    <p>“(When peace is established) the economic design for the Korean Peninsula will be realized, rail network will be linked to Europe, and to the south, a community of peace and prosperity with the ASEAN and India will be established.”</p>
    <p>Moon was referring to his New Southern Policy and New Northern Policy, which aim to increase South Korea’s economic and political relations with countries to the south and southwest, as well as north of the Korean Peninsula. </p>
    <p>HWACHEON, South Korea, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's leading winter event, the "2019 Hwacheon Sancheoneo Ice Festival," will kick off its 23-day run in the remote mountainous county of Hwacheon later this week, the event's organizer said Wednesday. </p>
    <p>"The annual festival, the 16th this year, will run from Jan. 5-27," the organizer said, adding the event is a joint project between the county bordering North Korea and its 27,000 residents in an effort to activate the sluggish local economy.</p>
    <p>Launched in 2003, the event was chosen as the nation's best festival by the culture ministry in 2010 and has developed into one of the world's four major winter festivals.</p>
